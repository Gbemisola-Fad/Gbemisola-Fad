## About Me

I have years of experience in sales, customer service, and business development, along with practical skills in AWS, DevOps, and Agile methods to tackle big problems.
I'm currently moving into cloud-related jobs, combining my business knowledge with technical skills, really focusing on cloud computing. I've learned to use AWS services like EC2,VPC, S3, IAM, Lambda, Amazon RDB and CloudWatch, and I can write scripts in Python and Bash. I also explore DevOps automation with tools like CI/CD and CloudFormation. I enjoy building scalable systems and creating effective business solutions, working at the crossroads of technology and making a difference.
