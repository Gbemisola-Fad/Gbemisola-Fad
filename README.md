## About Me

I used to work in business management, but now I'm focused on cloud computing. I have years of experience in sales, customer service, and business development, along with practical skills in ### AWS, ### DevOps, and ###  Agile methods to tackle big problems. I'm currently moving into cloud-related jobs, combining my business knowledge with technical skills. I've learned to use AWS services like EC2,VPC, S3, IAM, Lambda, Amazon RDB and CloudWatch, and I can write scripts in Python and Bash.

I enjoy building scalable systems and creating effective business solutions, working at the crossroads of technology and making a difference.
